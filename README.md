Flows are vey powerful in SF but it comes with its own modus operandi. 
One of the shortcomings in the Out of Box flows is that we cannot see a list of records in a single screen. 
One has to press "Next" to traverse to the next record, which can become a pain in many use cases.

Introducing "ShowList", a custom screen component that can be used to display a list of records in a single view.

In this instance we are using it to display a related list on the Account object, but this can be used in many more ways.

This is a SFDX project, and has an unmanaged package by the name ShowList which has the intended code in it.

The code is explained on linked in here
